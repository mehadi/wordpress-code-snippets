# How to Replace Post Title `<h2>` with `<h1>` in WordPress

This PHP function is designed to replace the default `<h2>` tag containing the post title with `<h1>` on single post pages within WordPress.

## Functionality:

- **Replace Post Title**: The function identifies the post title wrapped in an `<h2>` tag with a specific class (`entry-title`) and replaces it with an `<h1>` tag containing the same post title.
- **Single Post Page Check**: It ensures that this replacement only occurs on single post pages using the `is_single()` WordPress function.
- **Filter Hook Integration**: The function is integrated into the WordPress content filter (`the_content`) to execute the replacement when the content is being displayed.

## Parameters:

- **$content**: The content of the post/page being filtered.

## Usage:

- This function should be added to the WordPress theme's `functions.php` file or a custom plugin.
- It will automatically modify the post title structure on single post pages.

## Example:

```php
// Function to replace post title <h2> with <h1>
function replace_post_title_h2_with_h1($content) {
    // Check if we're on a single post page
    if (is_single()) {
        // Get the post title
        $post_title = get_the_title();

        // Replace <h2> tags with class 'entry-title' with the post title
        $content = preg_replace('/<h2\s+class="entry-title">(.*?)<\/h2>/', '<h1>' . $post_title . '</h1>', $content, 1); // Replace only the first occurrence
    }
    return $content;
}
// Add filter hook to execute the function
add_filter('the_content', 'replace_post_title_h2_with_h1');
```

# Note:
* It's important to ensure that the theme's HTML structure matches the pattern targeted by the regular expression for the replacement to occur accurately.
* Customization might be needed if the theme uses a different class or structure for post titles.
